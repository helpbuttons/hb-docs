## Maria wants to help animals

Maria found several animals in their neighbourhood and wants to connect the local animal refuge with the neighbours. She creates a network in helpbuttons and ask some friends to register too in order to administrate the community. While creating the net she selects her region in Murcia as starting area for the network (so when a person visit the URL the map zooms into her region), adds her friends as administrators, selects an animal rescue module developed by the community and adds it to the network.

During the next weeks she and her friends start posting buttons (she called them 'animals' in their network) when they receive notifications or whenever they find them on the streets. Their posts have place for adding tags like 'dog', 'ill', cat', 'hungry'; also they can add images or an 'attended' tag in order to track which ones were assisted. They also decided to make the chats in their buttons 'group chats',so they can all be synced in what's happening in each new button they take part.
