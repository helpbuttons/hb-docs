# Philosophy of the project 

# History

We've been working on this concept since 2012, testing and changing prototypes and teams, and now -after many tests, mock-ups and 2 beta versions- we have a better design and understanding of what Helpbuttons should be.

During the 2021 COVID crisis, the team could make some tests and imporved the first prototype. Also realised of the need of better social cooperation. If we want to be prepared, we need to cultivate connections and social integration with better tools every day.

Collaborative apps require a big amount of technical support and design that can't be afforded with just one in-app purpose. We see that lots of useful collaborative apps won't survive if they serve just one commitment, or just serve a small community, because the amount of work that needs to be done makes the project unsustainable. Making an app to help elders in your town can be an useful tool that, in many cases, won't get enough economical and proffesional support to live. That work is probably being done by so many others in other areas for so many small community purposes, like food sharing, transport sharing, house sharing and so may others. Why don't we unify the efforts? Is it possible?

We think it's possible so we've been analyzing the main collaborative apps to see what they have in common. The design consist in a base squeleton with main fields that share all these apps and modules that can be designed, added andd removed to customize the app to your needs. We need people to help in refining these designs, sustain the community support and develop modules that addapt the base design to more purposes.


# Â¿Where do we want to go?

Helpbuttons wants to become a tool to coordinate social cooperation. Specially in disjointed collectives where the individuals don't know each other very well. Neighbourhoods, towns, valleys, regions, asociations... could use helpbuttons to cooperate in sharing food, playing sports, map resources, sell objects, ask for special help ... .  The ideal state of Helpbuttons would be a set of networks, that can federate to share users and content between them.
