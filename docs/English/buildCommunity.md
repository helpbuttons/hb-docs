# Build Community

Helpbuttons is an app designed for community leaders. If you're a person worried for your community wellness and cooperation, this is an app for you. Although we continue testing the app features with final users, so we get the best IU/UX design, the success of a ne Networks project depends on the compromise and action of the Network's Admins that need to spread the information and ussage in their intended community. We can offer you all the support of our experiences and some suggestions about methods for getting the communities to use the app in the first days of the project.

# Some possible actions:

## Print and paste signs with your network domain and QR codes (and even phone). 

## Organize live session. Meet, talk, interact live with other people so they know and trust. Trust is the basis for a digital tool to be used.

## Organize online sessions. Being an online tool allows to explain in remote. Meet with your community online and explain them, record the session for people that could not be there at that moment. 

## Use the tool. If you believe in the principles, use them. Create content and use the app in the same way as the others, that helps everyone to understand why the initiative is useful.

## Add more administrators. Share the responsability. It's good not only for reducing the amount of work but for explaining others and make them trust you.
