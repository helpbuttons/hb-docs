# Welcome to Helpbuttons Documentation

This is a WIP area that can be updated while the project lives. Feel free to advice or propose any section that should be included.

# ¿What's HelpButtons?

Helpbuttons.org is an opensource platform for collaborative network making. It's a CMS for cooperative websites -like uber, glovo, blablacar and so many others- specialized in connecting unknown people by purposes in real life. Shortly, we want to democratize collaborative-apps-creation and we need a big community for this to be sustainable in time.

# ¿How can HelpButtons exist?

We've been working on this concept since 2012 (yeah, WTF), testing and changing prototypes and teams, and now -after many tests, mock-ups and 2 beta versions- we have a better design and understanding of what Helpbuttons should be.

Collaborative apps require a big amount of technical support and design that can't be afforded with just one in-app purpose. We see that lots of useful collaborative apps won't survive if they serve just one commitment, or just serve a small community, because the amount of work that needs to be done makes the project unsustainable. Making an app to help elders in your town can be an useful tool that, in many cases, won't get enough economical and proffesional support to live. That work is probably being done by so many others in other areas for so many small community purposes, like food sharing, transport sharing, house sharing and so may others. Why don't we unify the efforts? Is it possible?

We think it's possible so we've been analyzing the main collaborative apps to see what they have in common. The design consist in a base squeleton with main fields that share all these apps and modules that can be designed, added andd removed to customize the app to your needs. We need people to help in refining these designs, sustain the community support and develop modules that addapt the base design to more purposes.
