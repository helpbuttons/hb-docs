# Â¿What's HelpButtons?

Helpbuttons.org is an opensource tool for collaborative network making. It's a CMS for cooperative websites -like airbnb, uber, glovo, blablacar and so many others- specialized in connecting unknown people by purposes in real life. Shortly, we want to democratize collaborative-apps-creation, and we're designing a tool for building those types of websites without programming knowledge.
